        Technologies are the ways that humans use scientific knowledge to create practical solutions for various problems. Technologies can be seen in many aspects of our lives, such as transportation, communication, health, education, entertainment, and more. Technologies can also have positive or negative impacts on society, the environment, and the economy. Some examples of technologies are:
        - Messenger RNA vaccines: These are a new type of vaccines that use genetic material to instruct cells to produce proteins that can trigger an immune response against a virus. Messenger RNA vaccines have been used to fight the covid-19 pandemic, and they could also be used to prevent or treat other diseases in the future⁵².
        - GPT-3: This is a large computer model that can generate natural language texts based on a given input. GPT-3 can write and speak in a realistic and sometimes bizarre way, mimicking human language. GPT-3 can also answer questions, create summaries, and perform other tasks that require language understanding³.
        - TikTok recommendation algorithms: These are the algorithms that power the popular social media app TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos. The algorithms analyze the preferences and behaviors of users and show them personalized content that they are likely to enjoy and engage with. The algorithms also help users discover new and emerging trends, talents, and topics³.
